        <p>The term ‘Green Computing’ is the study and practices that
          covers the computing lifecycle from cradle to grave. It
          start from design to manufacturing to use of equipment and
          then safely disposing-off computers, related devices,
          networking and communications equipments efficiently and
          effectively with negligible or no impact on the environment.
          First and most conclusive research on computing shows
          that Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and other emissions are causing
          global climate and environmental damage. Preserving our
          beloved planet is a main and legitimate goal because it aims to
          preserve life. It has given extreme attention by researchers and
          professionals to minimize e-waste and use of non-toxic
          materials in preparation of e-equipments.<br><br> Energy efficiency is
          increasingly important for future ICT (Information and
          Communication Technologies) as the cost, and availability of
          energy is rising day by day. The increased usage of ICT with
          increasing energy costs and the need to reduce greenhouse gas
          emissions demand for energy-efficient technologies that
          decrease the overall energy consumption of computation,
          storage and communications. The very first and most
          conclusive research shows that CO2 and other emissions are
          causing global climate and environment a huge damage.
          Therefore it is the top most priority and challenge for Green
          Computing technologist to preserve our beloved planet. On
          the other hand a study by “The Climate Group” entitled Smart
          2020 <mark>(http://www.theclimategroup.org/programs/ict/)</mark> predicts
          that, greenhouse gas emissions from the Internet industry will
          raise to approximately 1.3 Giga-tons of CO2, and the
          combined impact of smart grid; smart logistics; smart
          buildings; and videoconferencing could reduce emissions by
          approximately 7.8 tons. </p>

    <h2>Current Trends</h2></div>
    <div class="trends">
      <div class="content">
        <p>Current trends of Green Computing are towards efficient
          utilization of resources. Energy is considered as the main
          resource and the carbon footprints are considered the major
          threads to environment. Therefore, the emphasis is to reduce
          the energy utilization & carbon footprints and increase the
          performance of Computing. There are several areas where
          researchers are putting lots of efforts to achieve desired
          results:</p>
          <h3>1.Energy Consumption</h3>
                <p>Organizations are realizing that the source and amount of
                their energy consumption significantly contributes to
                Greenhouse Gas (GhG) emissions. In response to this finding,
                organizations are currently using the following equation:
                <br><span>Reduced energy consumption = Reduced greenhouse gas emissions = Reduced operational costs for the data center</span><br>
                It means adopting fewer and more energy efficient systems
                while refactoring application environments to make optimal
                use of physical resources is the best architectural model.
                According to Environmental Protection Agency in around 30%
                to 40% of personal computers are kept 'ON' after office hours
                and during the weekend and even around 90% of those
                computers are idle.</p>
                <h3>2.E-Waste Recycling</h3>
                <p>Based on the Gartner estimations over 133,000 PCs are
                discarded by U.S. homes and businesses every day and less
                than 10 percent of all electronics are currently recycled.
                Majority of countries around the world require electronic
                companies to finance and manage recycling programs for their
                products especially under-developed Countries. Green
                Computing must take the product life cycle into consideration;
                from production to operation to recycling.
                </p>
                <h3>3.Virtualization</h3>
                   <p> One of the main trends of Green Computing is virtualization 
                    of computer resources. Abstraction of computer resources, 
                    such as the running two or more logical computer systems on 
                    one set of physical hardware is called virtualization. 
                    Virtualization is a trend of Green computing it offers 
                    virtualization software as well as management software for 
                    virtualized environments. One of the best ways to go 
                    towards green and save enough space, enough resources, and 
                    the environment is by streamlining efficiency with 
                    virtualization. This form of Green Computing will lead to 
                    Server consolidation and enhance computer security. 
                    Virtualization runs fewer systems at higher levels of 
                    utilization. Virtualization allows full utilization of computer 
                    resources and benefits in: <br>
                    • Reduction of total amount of hardware <br>
                    • Power off Idle Virtual Server to save resources and
                    energy <br>
                    • Reduction in total space, air and rent requirements 
                    ultimately reduces the cost</p>

        <div class="content1">
          <p> According to researchers in the past the focus was on 
            computing efficiency and cost associated to IT equipments and 
            infrastructure services were considered low cost and available. 
            Now infrastructure is becoming the bottleneck in IT
            environments and the reason for this shift is due to growing 
            computing needs, energy cost and global warming. This shift 
            is a great challenge for IT industry. Therefore now researchers 
            are focusing on the cooling system, power and data center 
            space. At one extreme it is the processing power that is 
            important to business and on the other extreme it is the drive, 
            challenge of environment friendly system, and infrastructure 
            limitations . Green Computing challenges are not only for 
            IT equipments users but also for the IT equipments Vendors. 
            Several major vendors have made considerable progress in this 
            area, for example, Hewlett-Packard recently unveiled what it 
            calls “the greenest computer ever”—the HP rp5700 desktop 
            PC. The HP rp5700 exceeds U.S. Energy Star 4.0 standards, 
            and has an expected life of at least five years, and 90% of its 
            materials are recyclable . Dell is speeding up its programs 
            to reduce hazardous substances in its computers, and its new 
            Dell OptiPlex desktops are 50% more energy-efficient than 
            similar systems manufactured in 2005, credit goes to more 
            energy-efficient processors, new power management features, 
            and other related factors . IBM is working on technology to 
            develop cheaper and more efficient solar cells plus many other 
            solutions from IBM to support sustainable IT. According to 
            researchers of Green Computing following are few prominent 
            challenges that Green computing is facing today:<br> 
            • Equipment power density / Power and cooling 
            capacities; <br>
            • Increase in energy requirements for Data Centers 
            and growing energy cost; <br>
            • Control on increasing requirements of heat 
            removing equipment, which increases because of 
            increase in total power consumption by IT 
            equipments; <br>
            • Equipment Life cycle management – Cradle to 
            Grave; and <br>
            • Disposal of Electronic Wastes.

    <div class="title"> <h2>Future Trends</h2></div>
   
    <p>As discussed earlier the reason for shift is because of growth 
      in computing needs, energy cost and global warming and this 
      shift is great challenge for IT industry. The future of Green 
      Computing is going to be based on efficiency, rather than 
      reduction in consumption.The primarily focus of Green IT is in the organization’s self 
      interest in energy cost reduction, at Data Centers and at 
      desktops, and the result of which is the corresponding 
      reduction in carbon generation. The secondary focus of Green 
      IT needs to focus beyond energy use in the Data Center and 
      the focus should be on innovation and improving alignment 
      with overall corporate social responsibility efforts. This 
      secondary focus will demand the development of Green 
      Computing strategies. The idea of sustainability addresses the 
      subject of business value creation while ensuring that long term environmental resources are not impacted. There are few 
      efforts, which all enterprises are supposed to take care of : </p>

    <h3>1.Certifications</h3>
    <p>There are several organizations providing certificates to 
        green technology. Vendors are based on their product quality, 
        material, life of the product and recycling capabilities. In 
        future such certifications together with recommendations and 
        government regulations will put more pressure on vendors to 
        use green technology and reduce impact on environment. </p>
    <h3>2.Cloud Computing</h3>
    <p>Cloud Computing has recently received significant attention 
    , as a promising approach for delivering Information and 
    Communication Technology services by improving the 
    utilization of Data Center resources. In principle, cloud 
    computing is energy-efficient technology for ICT [12] 
    provided that it’s potential for significant energy savings that 
    have so far focused on only hardware aspects, can be fully 
    explored with respect to system operation and networking 
    aspects also. Cloud Computing results in better resource 
    utilization, which is good for the sustainability movement for 
    green technology. </p>
    <h3>3.Product Longevity</h3>
    <p>As per Gartner and Fujitsu reports on product life cycle it is 
    obvious that the product durability and/or longevity are one of 
    the best approaches towards achieving Green Computing 
    objectives [13]. Long life of product will allow more 
    utilization of products and it will put a control on unnecessary 
    manufacturing of products. It is obvious that government 
    regulations will push the products vendors to make more 
    efforts to increase the product life.</p> 
    <h3>4.Power Management Tools</h3>
    <p>Power management is proving to be one of the most 
    valuable and clear-cut techniques in near future to decrease 
    energy consumption. IT departments with focus on saving 
    energy can decrease use with a centralized power management 
    tool. Compiling data from Energy Star case studies for 7 
    deployments of 11,000 - 499,000 machines, it was found that 
    sleep scheduling was able to save between $10.75 and $95 per 
    computer per year. These deployments used a combination 
    Windows built-in sleep function, group policies, different 
    software systems, such as PC Power-down, EZ GPO, Tivoli 
    systems, BigFix etc.</p>
    <h3>5.Applications </h3>
    <p>Green Computing is a diverse field and due to its nature and 
    priority from all fields of life Green Computing has 
    applications in every sector of computing as the goal is to save 
    the environment and ultimately the life. The current main 
    applications of Green Computing are covering following 
    computing sectors:<br> 
    • Equipment design; <br>
    • Equipment recycling;<br> 
    • Data Center optimization and consolidation; <br>
    • Virtualization; <br>
    • Paper free environment;<br> 
    • Application Architecture;<br>
    • Power Management </p>

  <section id="conclusion" class="fade-in">
    <div class="title"> <h2>Conclusion</h2></div>
    <P>Technology is not a passive observer, but it is an active 
      contributor in achieving the goals of Green Computing. IT 
      industry is putting efforts in all its sectors to achieve Green 
      computing. Equipment recycling, reduction of paper usage, 
      virtualization, cloud computing, power management, Green 
      manufacturing are the key initiatives towards Green
      computing. Current challenges to achieve Green Computing 
      are enormous and the impact is on computing performance. 
      Efforts of Governments and Non-Government Organizations 
      (NGOs) are also appreciate-able. Government regulations are 
      pushing Vendors to act green; behave green; do green; go 
      green; think green; use green and no doubt to reduce energy 
      consumptions as well. All these efforts are still in limited 
      areas and currently efforts are mainly to reduce energy 
      consumption, e-Waste but the future of Green Computing will 
      be depending on efficiency and Green products. Future work 
      in Green Computing discipline will also rely on research work 
      in academics since this is an emerging discipline and there is 
      much more need to be done. There is need for more research 
      in this discipline especially within academic sector.</P>
